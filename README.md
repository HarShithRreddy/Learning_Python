# Learning_Python

This repository documents my journey of learning **Python from the ground up**, with a strong focus on writing clean code, understanding fundamentals, and building problem-solving skills.

The goal of this repository is to build a solid Python foundation before moving on to **data analysis and machine learning projects**.

---

## 📌 Topics Covered

- Python basics (variables, input/output)
- Control flow (if/else, loops)
- Functions
- Core data structures (lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries)
- File handling
- JSON handling
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Functional programming (list comprehensions, lambda, map, filter)

---

## 📚 Learning Resources

This repository is built through **hands-on practice and self-implementation**.  
Structured online resources (including curated Python courses) are used **only as references** to guide the learning process, while all code is written and modified independently.

---

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **Python 3**
- **Jupyter Notebooks** (for interactive practice and experimentation)
- **VS Code**
- **Git & GitHub**
